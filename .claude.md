# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Workflow - IMPORTANT

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Main Branch Protection**

**NEVER** perform the following actions on the `main` branch:
- ❌ Do NOT merge `dev` branch into `main`
- ❌ Do NOT make any modifications to `main` branch
- ❌ Do NOT push any changes to `main` branch
- ❌ Do NOT commit directly to `main` branch

**✅ ALWAYS work on:**
- `dev` branch (default development branch)
- Feature branches (when specified)
- Any branch OTHER than `main`

**Main branch is production-only and should only be updated manually by the project maintainers.**

## Development Workflow

1. **Always check current branch before making changes:**
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

2. **Make all changes in `dev` branch:**
   - All development work happens in `dev`
   - Test thoroughly in dev environment
   - Commit and push to `dev` only

3. **When explicitly requested to work on a different branch:**
   - Create or checkout the specified feature branch
   - Make changes in that branch
   - Push to that specific branch

4. **Main branch deployment:**
   - Production deployments from `main` are handled separately
   - Do NOT automate or perform merges to `main`

## Current Setup

- **Dev Branch**: Development and testing environment
- **Main Branch**: Production environment (hands-off)
- **Remote**: https://github.com/sriramanathanhu/social-Media-Asset-Management.git
