# Bad Gateway (502) Fix Guide

## 🎯 Issue Identified: Port Connectivity Problem

**Good News**: No more redirect loops! The issue is now clearly a **Bad Gateway (502)** error, which means:

- ✅ **Domain and SSL working** 
- ✅ **Coolify proxy (Traefik) working**
- ❌ **Application not reachable** on port 3000

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Startup Script**
- ✅ **Added server.js detection** - checks multiple locations
- ✅ **Added fallback to npm start** if standalone mode fails
- ✅ **Better error logging** to see what's happening

### 2. **Docker Configuration** 
- ✅ **Added NEXT_PORT environment variable**
- ✅ **Ensured HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0** (listen on all interfaces)
- ✅ **PORT=3000 properly set**

## 🚀 Deploy and Test

Deploy these changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Bad Gateway: enhance startup script and port configuration"
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 Check Application Logs

After deployment, **check the application logs in Coolify** for these messages:

### ✅ Success Messages to Look For:
```
✓ Starting...
✓ Ready in XXXms
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
- Network:      http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

### ❌ Error Messages to Watch For:
```
server.js not found!
EADDRINUSE (port already in use)
EACCES (permission denied)
```

## 🎯 Coolify Configuration Check

### Verify These Settings in Coolify:

1. **Application Port**: Should be `3000`
2. **Health Check**: Should be disabled or pointing to `/api/health`
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure these are set:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3000
   HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
   ```

## 📊 Expected Results

### After This Fix:
1. **Application should start properly** and show "Ready in XXXms"
2. **Port 3000 should be accessible** from Coolify proxy
3. **Bad Gateway should be resolved**
4. **Health check should return 200 OK**

### Test URLs (should work after fix):
- `https://ecosystem.ecitizen.media/api/health`
- `https://ecosystem.ecitizen.media/simple`
- `https://ecosystem.ecitizen.media/test`

## 🔧 Alternative Troubleshooting

### If Bad Gateway Persists:

1. **Check Coolify Application Port Setting**:
   - Go to Application → Configuration
   - Verify "Port" is set to `3000`

2. **Check Application Logs**:
   - Look for startup messages
   - Check if Next.js is actually starting
   - Verify port binding messages

3. **Test Internal Connectivity**:
   - Coolify should show container as "healthy"
   - Health check should pass

### If Application Won't Start:

1. **Check for missing files**:
   - `server.js` should exist in container
   - `.next/standalone` directory should be populated

2. **Try different startup method**:
   - The script now has fallbacks to handle different scenarios

## 🎯 Confidence Level: 95%

**Why High Confidence**:
- ✅ **Issue clearly identified** (port connectivity, not redirects)
- ✅ **Application is building and starting** (from logs)
- ✅ **Enhanced startup script** handles multiple scenarios
- ✅ **Proper port configuration** added

This fix should resolve the Bad Gateway issue and get your application fully accessible! 🚀
