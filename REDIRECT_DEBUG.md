# Redirect Loop Debug Guide

## 🚨 Current Situation
- ✅ **Application is starting successfully** (`Ready in 121ms`)
- ✅ **Database is working** (schema synchronized)
- ❌ **Still getting `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`**

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Since the application is starting correctly but redirects are still happening, this suggests the issue is **NOT** in the Next.js application code, but rather at the **proxy/infrastructure level**.

## 🧪 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Test Minimal Endpoints

Deploy these changes and test these URLs **in order**:

1. **Simple HTML Page** (most basic test):
   ```
   https://ecosystem.ecitizen.media/simple
   ```
   
2. **Test Page** (React component):
   ```
   https://ecosystem.ecitizen.media/test
   ```

3. **Health API** (JSON endpoint):
   ```
   https://ecosystem.ecitizen.media/api/health
   ```

### Step 2: Browser Testing

**Important**: Test in **incognito/private mode** to eliminate cookies:

1. **Clear ALL browser data** for the domain
2. **Disable browser extensions** 
3. **Try different browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors

### Step 3: If Test Pages Still Redirect

If even `/simple` and `/test` pages show redirect loops, the issue is **definitely** at the Coolify/proxy level, not the application.

## 🔧 Potential Coolify Configuration Issues

### 1. **SSL/HTTPS Redirect Loop**
- **Symptom**: Coolify proxy trying to redirect HTTP→HTTPS in a loop
- **Check**: Coolify SSL settings and force HTTPS configuration
- **Solution**: Review SSL certificate status and redirect rules

### 2. **Domain/DNS Configuration**
- **Symptom**: Multiple redirects due to domain resolution issues
- **Check**: DNS records pointing to correct Coolify instance
- **Solution**: Verify domain configuration in Coolify

### 3. **Proxy Configuration**
- **Symptom**: Traefik (Coolify's proxy) misconfigured
- **Check**: Coolify proxy logs and Traefik configuration
- **Solution**: Review proxy settings and routing rules

### 4. **Environment Variable Issues**
- **Symptom**: Next.js generating wrong URLs due to env vars
- **Check**: `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` settings
- **Solution**: Ensure they match your actual domain

## 🔍 Coolify-Specific Debugging

### Check Coolify Configuration:

1. **Application Settings**:
   - Verify domain is correctly set to `ecosystem.ecitizen.media`
   - Check port is set to `3000`
   - Ensure SSL is properly configured

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://ecosystem.ecitizen.media
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://ecosystem.ecitizen.media
   ```

3. **Proxy/Traefik Logs**:
   - Check Coolify proxy logs for redirect patterns
   - Look for SSL certificate issues
   - Review routing configuration

## 🚀 Quick Test Deploy

Deploy with these changes:
- ✅ **Middleware completely disabled** (no app-level redirects possible)
- ✅ **Simple test pages** available
- ✅ **Database working correctly**

## 📊 Expected Results

### If `/simple` and `/test` work:
- ✅ Application is fine
- ❌ Issue is in the home page (`/`) specifically
- 🔧 Re-enable middleware gradually

### If `/simple` and `/test` still redirect:
- ❌ Issue is at Coolify/proxy level
- 🔧 Check Coolify configuration
- 🔧 Review SSL and domain settings

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Deploy these debugging changes**
2. **Test `/simple` page first** in incognito mode
3. **If it works**: Issue is application-specific, can be fixed
4. **If it still redirects**: Issue is infrastructure-level, check Coolify settings

## 💡 Alternative Solutions

### If Coolify Configuration is the Issue:

1. **Try different domain** temporarily to test
2. **Disable SSL** temporarily to test HTTP
3. **Check Coolify documentation** for redirect settings
4. **Contact Coolify support** with specific error details

### If Application is the Issue:

1. **Gradually re-enable middleware** with more specific rules
2. **Check Next.js configuration** for redirect settings
3. **Review environment variables** for URL mismatches

## 🎯 Confidence Assessment

- **90% confident** this will identify the root cause
- **If `/simple` works**: Application can be fixed easily
- **If `/simple` redirects**: Coolify configuration needs adjustment

The key insight is that with middleware **completely disabled**, there should be **zero** application-level redirects possible.
